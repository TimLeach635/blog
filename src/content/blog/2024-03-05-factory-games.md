I don't think I can get across to you how much I love factory games.

It's the satisfaction of a smoothly working system doing its job in exactly the way I want.
It's the self-actualisation of _building something_, and watching your creation do the thing it was built to do.
It's the idea of an untainted space that is entirely mine, in which I am free to set my own goals and achieve them at my own pace.

Some of you may have raised your eyebrows at that last point. I know what you're thinking, and I'll get to it later.

In honour of the release of a demo for the upcoming factory game [Shapez 2](https://shapez2.com/), I'd like to talk about this very bizarre
genre of video game. Why does a certain type of brain enjoy it so much, how do different examples tackle game design problems in the genre...
and what does any of this have to do with colonialism!?

## A job well done

People like completing tasks. Speaking for myself, I get a big hit of dopamine whenever I can tick an item off my to-do list.
And that's one of the reasons video games are so popular, right? Video games present a task, or set of tasks, to the player,
and empower them to complete those tasks.

Games vary in how entertaining they make these tasks, of course -- who isn't tired of boring "find my favourite pot in a dungeon three miles away" side quests --
but that doesn't stop us from playing them, it just changes how much fun we have while playing. But even if a task is boring,
we are still driven to complete them, because the game empowers us to do so (and maybe because it shows us a little checklist
of all the tasks we are yet to do).

I love this, don't get me wrong. Life is complicated, and my real to-do list is very long, and very complicated.
"Lose 20kg" and "start cooking more" are two side-quests that are probably going to stay un-ticked for quite a while,
and "unpack boxes after moving house" is not something that can be completed in an afternoon!
But I can just open up my computer, and start a program that displays a new list of tasks, occupies me with lovely visuals, music,
and kinaesthetic feedback while I complete them, and helps me finish the whole list in a couple of hours. I _love_ that,
and I fear I would have gone mad with stress without that relief option.

But they're not _real_ tasks. They were handed to me, pre-decided, and the developers devised the ways in which they would be completed.
My path is clear, my end-goal is provided, and at any time it is fairly obvious what I am "supposed" to do.

In most factory games, you are given one goal.

And let me tell you this up front: I have _never_ completed a factory game.

How can it be satisfying if the goal is never reached? Well, in most factory games, the goal is intentionally very difficult,
and very far in the future. It's like giving a five-year-old the task "graduate university".
