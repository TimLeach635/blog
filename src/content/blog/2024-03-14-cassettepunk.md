## All the punks under the sun

There are a lot of "-punk"s out there at the moment. Steampunk, cyberpunk, solarpunk, atompunk, dieselpunk -- each of which referring to an aesthetic that seemingly tries to answer the question "what if an entire society was based around ________?"

Steampunk is the first of these I remember being aware of. Usually with trappings of Victorian England, the steampunk aesthetic envisions a world where everything is made of brass and powered by steam instead of electricity. Dieselpunk seems to be similar, but where everything is made of steel and powered by loud, smoky diesel engines (cf: the Nazi enemies you blow up in the new Wolfenstein games).

Solarpunk is a green, harmonic world where everything is solar powered and humanity is at last at one with nature; atompunk is a 1960s imagining of the distant future with ray guns and sleek flying cars; and cyberpunk is an often dystopian setting full of blue and pink neon, where much of the populace has cybernetic augmentations that run proprietary, corporate software.

Now, I'm a big fan of all of these (especially cyberpunk). I'm not sure why -- I think an itch gets scratched in my brain when everything in a world has the same design strategy. Our real world is full of lots of competing aesthetics and schools of design, and I get immense satisfaction when I get to explore a world where everything follows the same pattern taken to a logical extreme.

And "taken to a logical extreme" is right -- these designs are obviously completely impractical. It is extremely cool, for example, to see a refrigerator made of brass, covered in gears and whistles, churning away... but it is clearly not an optimal way to build a fridge. In fiction, we have a beautiful freedom to design objects, societies, and entire universes that don't need to be practical, they just need to look cool and feel good.

And in the face of all that, we have cassettepunk.

## The aesthetics of functionality

You may have heard the factoid that the computer in the Apollo 11 moon lander had less processing power than your smartphone. You may also be curious about the fact that the cockpits of modern aeroplanes are still packed full of physical switches, knobs, and little lights, when the design of most consumer items has trended away from physical controls (my mobile phone only has three buttons on it).

The reason for this is that high-tech, sleek solutions are not always the best solution, _especially when safety is important_. That HD touchscreen in your new Tesla may look cool and have pretty animations, but in my 15-year-old hatchback I can pause my music, turn on the windscreen wipers, change gears, and switch my headlights to full beam by touch alone, without taking my eyes off the road. Touch screens have no tactile element at all, and their use _requires_ glancing away from the road.

A few years ago, I remember hearing about a new model of fridge that could connect to the internet. It could keep track of all the items you had inside, and let you know when they were about to expire. This may be apocryphal, but I swear I remember hearing that it could even connect to Twitter.

Now, don't get me wrong, all that sounds great. I have quite bad ADHD, and I forget about the food I have in all the time. It would be really useful to offload all that work to a computer.

But I'm also a software developer. I work with computers every single day, and as a result I have intimate knowledge of all the _really stupid_ ways they can mess up.

There's a joke floating around the internet that goes like this.

> **Tech enthusiast:** I have a smart home, smart bulbs in every room, smart fridge, and a smart toaster. I can control the heating from my phone, and turn the oven off from my watch. I've set up automation to turn my lights on when I wake up, and I can answer my door from anywhere in the world!
